    DTD: spells out exactly what elements can appear in an XML document and in what order the elements can appear. DTD
         stands for Document Type Definition,
         validates the document to make sure that there are no structural errors

<!-- TODO define your own vocabulary/syntax. Example follows:  -->              
<!ELEMENT Movies (Movie*)>                                                      <!-- Movies consist of 0+ Movie elements -->
<!ELEMENT Movie (Title, Price)>                                                 <!-- Movie element consists of Title and Price -->
<!ATTLIST Movie year CDATA #REQUIRED>                                           <!-- ATTLIST tagprovides name of each attribute -->
<!ELEMENT Title (#PCDATA)>                                                      <!-- Title and Price consist of text data -->
<!ELEMENT Price (#PCDATA)>

<!-- Element tags define type of element that can appear in the doc and content of element type  -->
<!--ATTLIST element attribute type default-value> -->
<!-- Here’s a breakdown of this tag:
    » element names the element whose tag the attribute can appear in.
    » attribute provides the name of the attribute.
    » type specifies what can appear as the attribute’s value. The type can be any 
    of the items listed in Table 5-2 (P867).
    » default provides a default value and indicates whether the attribute is 
    required or optional. default can be any of the items listed in Table 5-3.
 Refer to Table 5.1 (P867) for how to specify element content 
- ATTLIST tag declaration from movies.dtd:
    <!ATTLIST Movie year CDATA #REQUIRED>
    This declaration indicates that the attribute goes with the Movie element, is 
    named year, can be any kind of data, and is required
- ATTLIST tag that specifies a list of possible values along with a default:
    <!ATTLIST Movie genre (SciFi|Action|Comedy|Drama) Comedy>
    This form of the ATTLIST tag lets you create an attribute that’s similar to an 
    enumeration, with a list of acceptable values
