/* To read a binary file, work with the following classes:
 * File - File itself
 * FileInputStream - connects input stream to the file
 * BufferedInputStream - creates a buffer 
 * DataInputStream - reads data from the stream (primitive and strings)
 * Program demonstrates reading and writing data in a binary file which has info about movies
 * All read method throw eof exception
