/* JavaFX - Java GUI package
 * GUI - Graphical User Interface

 * Perusing the Possibilities of JavaFX
   ------------------------------------------ 
    - Easily create complicated GUIs
    - Able to customize through CSS - refers to the appearance of the UI
    - All formatting info placed in a style sheet - text file providing rules for formatting properties
    - Following capabilities apply:
        » Visual effects.
        » Animation
        » 3-D objects: You can draw three-dimensional objects such as cubes, cylinders, 
        spheres, and more complex shapes.
        » Touch interface: JavaFX can handle touchscreen devices, such as smartphones and tab

 * Extending Application Class (refer to ClickMe examples)
   ---------------------------------------------------------
    - The Application class is responsible for managing the life cycle of a 
      JavaFX application. The life cycle consists of the following steps:
        1. Create an instance of the Application class.
        2. Call the init method.
        The default implementation of the init method does nothing, but you can 
        override the init method to provide any processing you want to be performed before the application’s user interface displays.
        3. Call the start method.
        The start method is an abstract method, which means that there is no default 
        implementation provided as a part of the Application class. 
        Must provide your own version of the start method. The start method is 
        responsible for building and displaying the user interface. 
        4. Wait for the application to end, which typically happens when the user 
        signals the end of the program by closing the main application window or 
        choosing the program’s exit command.
        During this time, the application isn’t really idle. Instead, it’s busy performing 
        actions in response to user events, such as clicking a button or choosing an 
        item from a drop-down list.
        5. Call the stop method.
        Like the init method, the default implementation of the stop method doesn’t 
        do anything, but you can override it to perform any processing necessary as 
        the program terminates, such as closing database resources or saving files.
